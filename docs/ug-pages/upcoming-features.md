The following section lists some of our upcoming features that we are excited to bring to you!

### Exporting to CSV file : `file export`

As important as it is to be able to import files, we also understand that you might have the need to export them.
RC4HDB will soon provide users with the ability to export data to `.csv` files.
The file will be safe to remove from the `[JAR file location]/data` folder.

Format: `file export FILE_NAME`

:information_source: The csv file will be exported in this [format](file-management.md#csv-file-format).<br>

Examples:
* `file export residents` will export the data from `residents.json` file into a `.csv` file named `residents.csv`.
