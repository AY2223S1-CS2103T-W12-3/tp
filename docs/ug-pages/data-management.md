### Finding your data file

RC4HDB **resident** and **venue** data is all stored locally on your hard disk in the `[JAR file location]/data` folder. This folder contains all the data folders which store the **resident** and **venue** data files. The default data folder that all copies of RC4HDB start out with is the `rc4hdb` folder.

Inside your data folder, there should be two [JSON](glossary.md#json) files, `resident_data.json` and `venue_data.json`, which store your **resident** and **venue** data respectively.

### Editing the data file

Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing the `resident_data.json` and `venue_data.json` found in your data folder. Do take note that this is not the recommended method to edit data.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, RC4HDB will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
</div>

### Saving the data

RC4HDB saves your data after every command. There is no need to save manually.
