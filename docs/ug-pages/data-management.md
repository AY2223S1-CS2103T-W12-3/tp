### Editing the data file

After familiarising yourself with **RC4HDB**, you are welcome to update data directly by editing the `resident_data.json` and `venue_data.json` found in your data folder. <span style="color:red">However, do take note that this is not the recommended method to edit data.</span>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, RC4HDB will discard all data and start with an empty data 
file at the next run.
</div>

### Saving the data
