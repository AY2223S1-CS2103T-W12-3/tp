As a CLI-optimized application, RC4HDB may not be the most intuitive for someone that is used to using the mouse. As
such, we have provided several simple *Quality-of-life* features that we hope can improve your experience of using RC4HDB.

## Keyboard shortcuts

To encourage keyboard usage, here are several keyboard shortcuts that you may find useful for your use:

Key | Functionality
----|------------------
`Esc`| Closes the Help Window if it's open
`F1` | Opens the Help Window if it's not open
`F2` | Highlights the first row of the displayed list
`F3` | Quick-access to the command input box
`Ctrl+Tab` | Switch between Resident and Booking tabs

This feature is especially useful if you want to refer to our Help Window which contains a summary of our most basic
commands. If you want a full summary of all our commands, refer to [here](command-summary.md)

### Accessing command history

Use the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys to navigate through the command history. This
is useful if your next command is similar to a previous command, or if you wish to revisit
your previous commands.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**
Only valid commands will be saved in the history!
</div>
