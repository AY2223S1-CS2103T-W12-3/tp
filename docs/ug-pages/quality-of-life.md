## Keyboard shortcuts

Inline with our optimization for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)**. Here are several keyboard shortcuts that
you may find useful for your use:

Key | Functionality
----|------------------
`Esc`| Closes the Help Window if it's open
`F1` | Opens the Help Window if it's not open
`F2` | Highlights the first row of the displayed list
`F3` | Quick-access to the command input box

### Accessing command history

Use the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys to navigate through the command history. This feature
is useful if your next command is similar to a previous command, or if you wish to revisit
your previous commands.
