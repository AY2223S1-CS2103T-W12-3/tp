### Exporting to CSV file : `export`

RC4HDB has the ability to export data to .csv files. The file will be safe to remove from the directory, `[JAR file location]/data`.

Format: `export FILE_NAME`

:information_source: The csv file will be exported in this [format](#csv-file-format).<br>

Examples:
* `export students.csv` will export the current data file into a csv file named `students.csv`
