## Introduction to RC4HDB

RC4HDB is a desktop application that helps you, as a RC4 housing management staff, to tend to the all housing
management related work, policies, and issues.

RC4HDB provides these main features:
* Add incoming residents.
* Access, modify details of residents.
* Filter through residents via house, gender, and more.
* Book venues available in RC4.
* Export a filtered list of residents.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
RC4HDB is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User
Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, RC4HDB can be a convenient and intuitive way to facilitate your day-to-day
workflow as a RC4 housing management staff.

## Quick start

Here is a quick start on how to get RC4HDB onto your computer.

### 1. Setup
Ensure you have [*Java 11*](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html) or
above installed on your Computer.

### 2. Install
Download the latest `rc4hdb.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/releases/).
Move the `rc4hdb.jar` file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for RC4HDB.

### 3. Running RC4HDB
Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
You may have noticed that upon double-clicking `rc4hdb.jar` for the first time, several files were created. **Do not
delete the folder called `data` as this would cause all your data to be deleted**
</div>

## Command Guide

Below shows a detailed breakdown of all rules that are applicable to the commands in RC4HDB. Don't be afraid that you
may have typed a command incorrectly as RC4HDB will step in as and when needed!

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are compulsory and must be entered by you, the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which you must enter, such as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken,
  unless otherwise specified.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
