2. Enhanced the filter feature to filter with different specifiers for multiple types of filters by adding `ResidentStringDescriptor` and `Specifier` classes and also modifying the above classes.
3. Added a remove command to delete multiple residents according to filters indicated by users by adding classes `RemoveCommand` and `RemoveCommandParser`.
